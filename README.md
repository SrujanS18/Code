Built a regression-based model to predict final innings scores in Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches based on live match data.

Used features such as current score, overs completed, wickets fallen, recent run rate, and team combinations. Cleaned and transformed match data, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and engineered features for better predictive power.

Trained models like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor to forecast final scores with improved accuracy
